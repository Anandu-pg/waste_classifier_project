    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="text-white">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="lead">Welcome to the presentation of the Waste Classification AI project. This project uses artificial intelligence to classify various types of waste to help improve recycling and waste management systems. The purpose of the project is to provide real-time suggestions on how to correctly dispose of different types of waste, contributing to a cleaner, more sustainable environment.</p>
